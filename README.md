# Puzzle

- **_In this tutorial we will be making a Sliding Image  Puzzle game._**
  
- **_This game will be made using only  windows form, C# and .NET in visual studio._**
  
- **_We will not be adding third party framework to make this application or use any games engine such as Unity or GODOT._**
  
- **_All of the components will be pure windows form and C# programming._**
  
- **_Sliding image puzzle is a game I have been meaning to do in windows form because its one of the most requested and well-known game._**
  
- **_Its not difficult to do but finding the right resources to do it is another question._**
  
- **_For this tutorial we made sure to including all of the source codes and refactored the code to make it easier for beginner programmers to follow._**

- **_For this game, it wonâ€™t use pre-made sliced images instead it will use the browse feature to import an image to the application, crop the image to match the tiles in the game and then load them to a picture box._**
  
- **_There is also a win condition in the code when you matched all of the pictures._**
  
- **_At any time, you can load another image and play it through._**
  
- **_In the code you will see we have a shuffle feature where it will shuffle the images when it loads so you can get right into solving the puzzle._**
