# Puzzle
In this tutorial we will be making a Sliding Image  Puzzle game. This game will be made using only  windows form, C# and .NET in visual studio. We will not be adding third party framework to make this application or use any games engine such as Unity or GODOT. All of the components will be pure windows form and C# programming. Sliding image puzzle is a game I have been meaning to do in windows form because its one of the most requested and well-known game. Its not difficult to do but finding the right resources to do it is another question. For this tutorial we made sure to including all of the source codes and refactored the code to make it easier for beginner programmers to follow.
